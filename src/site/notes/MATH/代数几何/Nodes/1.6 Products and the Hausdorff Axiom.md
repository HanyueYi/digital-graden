> [!lemma]
> If $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$ and $X\times Y$ exists, then $\mathrm{st}(X\times Y)\simeq \mathrm{st}(X)\times \mathrm{st}(Y)$, where $\mathrm{st}:\mathcal{C}\to \mathrm{Set},X\mapsto \mathrm{st}(X)$ is a forgetful functor.

**_Proof._**
For any $(x_0,y_0)\in \mathrm{st}(X)\times \mathrm{st}(Y)$, define $\mathbb{A}^0=\{p\}$ and $\mathbb{A}^0\to X,p\mapsto x_0$ and $\mathbb{A}^0\to Y,p\mapsto y_0$. By universal property, there exists unique $\theta:\mathbb{A}^0\to X\times Y$ and $\theta(p)\leftrightarrow (x_0,y_0)$. 

Conversely, for $w_0\in \mathrm{st}(X\times Y)$, we have $p(w_0)=x_0$ and $q(w_0)=y_0$ where $p,q$ are projection map.

**Remark.** We only need the fiber product is a prevariety. If $W=\cup_{\text{finite}}W_i$ with affine varieties $W_i$, then $W$ is a fiber product iff $\{W_i\}_i$ are fiber products. 

**_Proof._**
It is a sketch of proof generated by Gemini. 
1.  **Construction of $X \times Y$ (Set of Points and Algebraic Structure):**
    - If $X \subseteq k^{n_1}$ is defined by ideal $I \subset k[x_1,...,x_{n_1}]$ and $Y \subseteq k^{n_2}$ by ideal $J \subset k[y_1,...,y_{n_2}]$, then the set of points $X \times Y$ can be naturally viewed as the algebraic set $V(I+J)$ in $k^{n_1+n_2}$ defined by the ideal $I+J \subset k[x_1,...,x_{n_1}, y_1,...,y_{n_2}]$.
    - Its coordinate ring is $k[x_i, y_j] / (I+J)$. There is a standard isomorphism:
        
        $$k[x_i, y_j] / (I+J) \cong (k[x_i]/I) \otimes_k (k[y_j]/J) = R \otimes_k S$$
        
    - **Key Algebraic Fact:** Since $k$ is an algebraically closed field and $X, Y$ are varieties, $R$ and $S$ are integral domains. In this case, $R \otimes_k S$ is also an **integral domain**.
    - **Corollary:** Because $R \otimes_k S$ is an integral domain, the radical of the ideal generated by $I+J$ in $k[x_i, y_j]$ is a prime ideal. This means the algebraic set $X \times Y$ is **irreducible**. Therefore, $(X \times Y, \underline{o}_{X \times Y})$ is itself an **affine variety**, whose coordinate ring is precisely $R \otimes_k S$.

2.  **Verifying the Universal Property:**
    - We need to show that the constructed affine variety $X \times Y = \mathrm{Spec}(R \otimes_k S)$ satisfies the categorical definition of a product.
    - The projection maps $p: X \times Y \to X$ and $q: X \times Y \to Y$ are natural (algebraically corresponding to $R \hookrightarrow R \otimes_k S$ and $S \hookrightarrow R \otimes_k S$) and are morphisms.
    - Given any prevariety $W$ and two morphisms $r: W \to X$, $s: W \to Y$, we can first uniquely define a map of sets $t: W \to X \times Y$ such that $p \circ t = r, q \circ t = s$, namely $t(w) = (r(w), s(w))$.
    - We need to verify that $t$ is a morphism. This can be done by checking that the pullback $t^*$ maps regular functions on $X \times Y$ to regular functions on $W$. Since $\Gamma(X \times Y) = R \otimes_k S$ is generated by elements from $R$ and $S$, and since $r^*$ and $s^*$ already pull back elements of $R$ and $S$ to $\Gamma(W, \underline{o}_W)$ (because $r, s$ are morphisms), using the universal property of tensor products, one can show that $t^*$ is a ring homomorphism, and thus $t$ is a morphism.

3.  **Basis of Topology:**
    - The basis for the topology on an affine variety $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ is given by the principal open sets $D(h) = \{ P \in \mathrm{Spec}(A) \mid h \notin P \}$, where $h \in A$.
    - In $X \times Y = \mathrm{Spec}(R \otimes_k S)$, an element $h$ has the form $h = \sum f_i \otimes g_i$. The point $(x,y)$ corresponds to the maximal ideal $m_{(x,y)}$. The condition $h \notin m_{(x,y)}$ is usually interpreted as $h(x,y) \neq 0$, which means $\sum f_i(x) g_i(y) \neq 0$. Thus, these sets form a basis for the topology.

4.  **Local Ring:**
    - The local ring $\underline{o}_{Z,z}$ of an affine variety $Z = \mathrm{Spec}(A)$ at a point $z$ (corresponding to maximal ideal $m_z$) is the localization $A_{m_z}$.
    * Therefore, $\underline{o}_{(x,y)} = (R \otimes_k S)_{m_{(x,y)}}$.
    * The equivalent description given in the Red Book is that $\underline{o}_{(x,y)}$ is the localization of the ring $\underline{o}_x \otimes_k \underline{o}_y$ at the maximal ideal $m_x \cdot \underline{o}_y + \underline{o}_x \cdot m_y$.
    * (Here $\underline{o}_x = R_{m_x}$ and $\underline{o}_y = S_{m_y}$. $m_x \cdot \underline{o}_y$ denotes the ideal generated by elements $a \otimes b$ where $a \in m_x \subset \underline{o}_x, b \in \underline{o}_y$, and $\underline{o}_x \cdot m_y$ is similar. This ideal corresponds to the functions in $\underline{o}_x \otimes_k \underline{o}_y$ that vanish at $(x,y)$. Note: The corresponding formula in the original notes was incorrect).

Now we finish the proof.

## in the Category of Prevarieties

> [!theorem]
> Let $X$ and $Y$ be prevarieties over $k$. Then they have a product.
{ #bhm6u8}


**_Proof._**
Assume $Y$ is affine. Then $X=\cup_{i=1}^\ell X_i$ with $X_i$ affine and $X_i\times Y$ exists as an affine variety by [[#^f0237a]]. Since $(X_1\cap X_2)\times Y$ is an open set in both $X_1\times Y$ and $X_2\times Y$. Then we can glue $X_1\times Y$ and $X_2\times Y$ along $(X_1\cap X_2)\times Y$. Now we get a topological space, and then we construct a sheaf on it by 

$$\underline{o}_{(X_1\cup X_2)\times Y}(U)=\cap_{(x_0,y_0)\in (X_1\cup X_2)\times Y}\underline{o}_{(x_0,y_0)}\subseteq k(X_1)\otimes k(X_2).$$

Assume $Y$ is affine. Then $X=\cup_{i=1}^\ell X_i$ with $X_i$ affine and $X_i\times Y$ exists as an affine variety by [[#^f0237a]]. Since $(X_1\cap X_2)\times Y$ is an open set in both $X_1\times Y$ and $X_2\times Y$. Then we can glue $X_1\times Y$ and $X_2\times Y$ along $(X_1\cap X_2)\times Y$ using the identity map. Repeating this for all pairs $i, j$ yields a topological space $Z$. We construct a sheaf $\underline{o}_Z$ on $Z$ by defining its sections on open sets $U \subseteq Z$:

$$\underline{o}_Z(U) = \left\{ f: U \to k :\forall i, f|_{U \cap (X_i \times Y)} \in \underline{o}_{X_i \times Y}(U \cap (X_i \times Y)) \right\}.$$

Now we verify $(Z,\underline{o}_Z)$ is a prevariety. Notice that $\{X_i \times Y\}_{i=1}^\ell$ is a finite cover of $Z$, where $X_i\times Y$ are irreducible affine varieties. Also note that $X_i\times Y$ and $X$ are connected, then $Z$ is also connected, because [[MATH/代数几何/Nodes/HW5#^ci5qpk\|a space covered by finitely many connected open sets with overlapping intersections is connected.]] Therefore, $(Z,\underline{o}_Z)$ is a prevariety. Define $Z=X\times Y$. 

It remains to check the universal property. For any prevariety $W$ and $r: W \to X, s: W \to Y$, define $t:W\to X\times Y,w\mapsto (r(w),s(w))$. Then it remains to check $t$ is a morphism. Take a finite open cover $\{W_k\}$ of $W$ such that $r(W_k)\subseteq X_i$ for some $i$. Then $t|_{W_k}:W_k\to X_i\times Y$ is a morphism by [[#^f0237a]]. 

By [[MATH/代数几何/Nodes/1.5 Definition of Prevarieties and Morphisms#^r0ujqi\|the definition of morphism]], it suffices to show for any open set $V\subseteq X\times Y$ and $g\in \Gamma(V,\underline{o}_{X\times Y})$, $g\circ t\in \Gamma(t^{-1}(V),\underline{o}_W)$. For any $w\in t^{-1}(V)$, there exists $W_0\in\{W_k\}$ containing $w$ such that $t|_{W_0}$ is a morphism. Define $W_1=W_0\cap t^{-1}(V)$, then $t|_{W_1}$ is also a morphism. It deduces that 

$$(g\circ t)|_{W_1}\in \Gamma(t_{W_1}^{-1}(V),\underline{o}_{W_1})=\Gamma(W_1,\underline{o}_{W_1}).$$

That is, $g\circ t$ is regular at $w\in W_1$ for any $w\in t^{-1}(V)$. Thus $g\circ t\in \Gamma(t^{-1}(V),\underline{o}_W)$ and so $t$ is a morphism. The uniqueness is easy to check.

In general, prevariety $Y$ can be written as $Y=\cup_{j}Y_j$ with $Y_j$ affine. As $X\times Y_j$ exists, we can glue $X\times Y_1$ and $X\times Y_2$ along $X\times (Y_1\cap Y_2)$. Similarly, we can get a topological space $Z'=X\times Y$, which satisfies the universal property. 

**Remark.** For affine $X$ and $Y$, take open $U\subseteq X$, then $U\times Y$ is open in $X\times Y$. 


## in the Category of Projective Varieties

> [!theorem]
> The product of two projective varieties is a projective variety.

**_Proof._**
Assume $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ and $Y\subseteq \mathbb{P}^m$, then $X\times Y\subseteq X\times \mathbb{P}^m\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb{P}^m\to \mathbb{P}^N$ where $N=(n+1)(m+1)-1$. Define the Segre embedding

$$\mathrm I:\mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb{P}^m\to \mathbb{P}^N,[x_0,\cdots,x_n],[y_0,\cdots,y_m]\to [\cdots,x_iy_j,\cdots]$$

and $\mathrm I$ is injective. 

It suffices to show $(\mathbb{P}^n)_{x_0}\times (\mathbb{P}^m)_{y_0}\to \mathbb{P}^N$ is a closed embedding, that is, the image of $I$ is a subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^N$. Note that 

$$\begin{aligned}
(\mathbb{P}^n)_{x_0}\times (\mathbb{P}^m)_{y_0}&\to \mathbb{P}^N\\
\big((s_1,\cdots,s_n),(t_1,\cdots,t_n)\big)&\mapsto (\cdots,R_{ij},\cdots)
\end{aligned}$$

where $s_i=x_i/x_0$, $t_j=y_j/y_0$ and $R_{ij}=s_it_j$ if $ij\neq 0$ and $R_{0j}=t_j$, $R_{i0}=s_i$. Then $\mathrm{im}(\mathrm I)=I(R_{ij}-R_{i0}\cdot R_{0j}:i,j\geqslant 1)$, that is, the ideal generated by $R_{ij}-R_{i0}R_{0j}$. 

Check that

$$\begin{aligned}
k[s_1,\cdots,s_n]\otimes k[t_1,\cdots,t_m]\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}k[\cdots,R_{ij},\cdots]/(R_{ij}-R_{i0}R_{0j})_{i,j}\\
\Gamma(\mathrm{im}(\mathrm I))\to \Gamma((\mathbb{P}^n)_{x_0}\times \Gamma(\mathbb{P}^m)_{y_0}), R_{ij}\mapsto s_i\otimes t_j
\end{aligned}$$

is a morphism between affine variety. So $f$ is an isomorphism.

**Example.** Let $Y=X \times X, f=p_1$, $g=p_2$. Also let $\Delta: X \longrightarrow X \times X$ be a morphism $\left(\mathrm{id}_X, \mathrm{id}_X\right)$. $\Delta$ is called the diagonal morphism, and

$$\Delta(X)=\left\{z \in X \times X \mid p_1(z)=p_2(z)\right\}.$$

Therefore the Hausdorff axiom implies $\Delta(X)$ is closed. In fact, we can prove that for a topological space $X$, $X$ is Hausdorff iff $\Delta(X)$ is closed.




> [!proposition]
> Let $X$ be a prevariety. Then $X$ is a variety if and only if $\Delta(X)$ is closed in $X \times X$.
{ #t398yf}


**_Proof._**
Suppose $f, g: Y \rightarrow X$ are given. Then they induce a morphism $(f, g): Y \rightarrow$ $X \times X$. Since

$$\{y \in Y \mid f(y)=g(y)\}=\theta^{-1}(\Delta(X))$$

$\Delta(X)$ being closed implies the Hausdorff axiom, so $X$ is a variety.

![Pasted image 20250421015824.png|200](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Pasted%20image%2020250421015824.png)

Conversely, if $X$ is a variety, then take $Y=X\times X$ with $f=p_1,g=p_2$ and $\Delta(X)=\{z\in Y:p_1(z)=p_2(z)\}$ is closed.

> [!proposition]
> $X$ is variety, and $Z\subseteq X$ is a closed sub-prevariety. Then $Z$ is a variety.

**_Proof._**
![Pasted image 20250327144855.png|200](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Pasted%20image%2020250327144855.png)


Since $X$ is variety, $\{y\in Y:(j\circ f)(y)=(j\circ g)(y)\}$ is closed and so $\{y\in Y:f(y)=g(y)\}$ is closed. Hence $Z$ is a variety.
<p align="right">□</p>


> [!proposition]
> $X,Y$ are varieties, then $X\times Y$ is variety. 

**_Proof._**
Let $W$ be an arbitrary prevariety, and let $f, g: W \to X \times Y$ be two arbitrary morphisms. By definition, it suffices to show

$$ E = \{ w \in W \mid f(w) = g(w) \} $$

is a closed subset of $W$.

Let $p_X: X \times Y \to X$ and $p_Y: X \times Y \to Y$ be the projection morphisms. We can decompose the morphisms $f$ and $g$ into their components:
- $f_1 = p_X \circ f : W \to X$
- $f_2 = p_Y \circ f : W \to Y$
- $g_1 = p_X \circ g : W \to X$
- $g_2 = p_Y \circ g : W \to Y$

Since compositions of morphisms are morphisms, $f_1, f_2, g_1, g_2$ are all morphisms. Note that $w\in E$ iff both $f_1(w)=g_1(w)$ and $f_2(w)=g_2(w)$ hold. Let $E_1 = \{ w \in W \mid f_1(w) = g_1(w) \}$ and $E_2 = \{ w \in W \mid f_2(w) = g_2(w) \}$, then one know $E=E_1\cap E_2$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are varieties, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are closed and so for $E$.
<p align="right">□</p>


> [!proposition]
> Affine variety is a variety.

**_Proof._**
Let $X$ be an affine variety, and let $R = \Gamma(X, \underline{o}_X)$ be its coordinate ring. To show $X$ is an variety, it suffices to show for any prevariety $Y$ and any morphisms $f, g: Y \to X$, the equalizer $E = \{ y \in Y \mid f(y) = g(y) \}$ is closed in $Y$.

For any $s \in R$, the functions $s \circ f$ and $s \circ g$ are global regular functions on $Y$ since $f, g$ are morphisms. Then their difference $(s \circ f) - (s \circ g)$ is also a global regular function on $Y$. Note that $y\in E$ iff $s(f(y)) = s(g(y))$ for all $s \in R$. So $E$ can be written that
 
$$E = V(\{ (s \circ f) - (s \circ g) \mid s \in R \}).$$

By definition of a prevariety, $E$ is a closed subset of $Y$. Now we finish the proof.

***Alternating proof.*** Let $X$ be an affine variety, embedded as a closed subset in some affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$. Then the product $X \times X$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{A}^n \times \mathbb{A}^n \cong \mathbb{A}^{2n}$. Note that 

$$\Delta(\mathbb{A}^n) = \{ (a, a) \mid a \in \mathbb{A}^n \} \subseteq \mathbb{A}^n \times \mathbb{A}^n$$

is defined by the equations $x_1 - y_1 = 0, \dots, x_n - y_n = 0$, where $(x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_n)$ are coordinates on $\mathbb{A}^n \times \mathbb{A}^n$. This is clearly a closed set.

It follows that $\Delta(X) = \Delta(\mathbb{A}^n) \cap (X \times X)$ is still closed in $\mathbb{A}^{2n}$ and is also a closed subset of $X \times X$. By [[#^t398yf]], $X$ is a variety.

> [!proposition]
> $\Delta(X)$ is locally closed. Remark that we say $Z\subseteq X$ is locally closed if for any $z_0\in Z$, there exists open $U\subseteq X$ containing $z_0$ such that $Z\cap U$ is closed in $U$. 

**_Proof._**
Take $Y=X\times X$ with $f=p_1,g=p_2$. Then $Z=\Delta(X)$ is closed in $Y$. For any $z\in Z$, let $V$ be an affine open neighborhood of $f(z)$ in $X$. Remark that $f(z)=g(z)$. Then

$$
Z \cap\left[f^{-1}(V) \cap g^{-1}(V)\right]=\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
z \in f^{-1}(V) \cap g^{-1}(V) & \begin{array}{l}
f(z)=g(z) \\
\text { in the affine } \\
\text { variety }
\end{array}
\end{array}\right\}
$$

where $U:=f^{-1}(V)\cap g^{-1}(V)$ is an open set containing $z$. Define $f'=f|_U$ and $g'=g|_U$, then $f',g'$ are morphisms from $U$ to $V$. Since $V$ is a variety, $\{z'\in U:f'(z)=g'(z)\}$ is closed in $U$, where $\{z'\in U:f'(z)=g'(z)\}=U\cap Z$. Now we finish the proof.

- $\Delta(X)$ is closed in $X\times X$. 
- $U\times V\subseteq X\times X$ open, $U\times V$ is affine.
