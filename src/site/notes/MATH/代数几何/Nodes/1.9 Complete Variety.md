**Resultant.** For $f(x)=a_nx^n+\cdots+a_0$ and $g(x)=b_mx^m+,,,+b_m$, there exists $\mathrm{Res}(f,g)\in k[a_0,\cdots,a_n,b_0,\cdots,b_m]$ such that $f(x),g(x)$ have a common root iff $\mathrm{Res}(f,g)=0$. 

**Higher-dimensional case. (elimination theory).** 

Main theorem of elimination theory

Given $r$ polynomials, with coefficients in $k$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
f_1\left(x_0, \ldots, x_n ; y_1, \ldots, y_m\right) \\
\ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \\
f_r\left(x_0, \ldots, x_n ; y_1, \ldots, y_m\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

all of which are homogeneous in the variables $x_0, \ldots, x_n$, there is a second set of polynomials (with coefficients in $k$ ):

$$
\begin{gathered}
g_1\left(y_1, \ldots, y_m\right) \\
\ldots \ldots \ldots . \\
g_\nu\left(y_1, \ldots, y_m\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

such that for all $m$-tuples $\left(a_1, \ldots, a_m\right)$ in $k, g_i\left(a_1, \ldots, a_m\right)=0$, all $i$ if and only if there is a non-zero $(n+1)$-tuple $\left(b_0, \ldots, b_n\right)$ in $k$ such that $f_i\left(b_0, \ldots, b_m ; a_1, \ldots, a_m\right)=0$, all $i$. 


For any closed set $Z\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb{A}^m$, $p_r(Z)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^m$ is closed, where

$$\begin{aligned}p_r: \mathbb{P}^n \times \mathbb{A}^m &\rightarrow \mathbb{A}^m \\ \left(\left[b_0: \cdots: b_n\right],\left(a_1, \ldots, a_m\right)\right)&\mapsto\left(a_1, \ldots, a_m\right)\end{aligned}$$

**_Proof._**
$X=\cup X_i$ where $X_i$ are affine open set. If the statement holds for any $X_i$, so for $X$. Define $Y=\mathbb{P}^n$. 

Since $Z\subseteq Y\times X$ is closed, $Z\cap (Y\cap X_i)$ is closed in $Y\times X_i$. Then $p_r(Z\cap(Y\times X_i))=p_r(Z)\cap X_i$ is closed in $X_i$. 

It remains to show $p_r(z)\cap X_i$ closed in $X_i$ yields $p_i(Z)$ closed. Notice that 

$$X-p_r(Z)=(\cup X_i)\cap (p_r(Z)^c)=\cup(X_i\cap p_r(Z)^c)=\cup (X_i-p_r(Z))$$

is open. 

Now we can assume $X$ is affine. There is an embedding $X\hookrightarrow \mathbb{A}^m$. Then $Z\subseteq Y\times X\hookrightarrow Y\times \mathbb{A}^m$. consider a commutative diagram 15:08

> [!definition]
> $X$ is a complete variety if for any $Y$ variety, $X\times Y\stackrel{p_r}{\to}Y$ is a closed map. (universal closed)

If $X$ is a complex manifold, then $X$ is universally closed iff $X$ is compact. 

HW: $X$ compact yields universal closed

"->" If $X$ is universal closed, then $X$ is compact.

(exist compactification $\widetilde X$ and $X\hookrightarrow \widetilde X$ is an open dense subset)

Consider $\Gamma_j:\{(x,x)\in X\times \widetilde X:x\in X\}$. If $\widetilde X$ is Hausdorff, then $\Gamma_j$ is closed: because $\Gamma_j=\theta^{-1}(\Delta)$ where $\theta:X\times \widetilde X\to \widetilde X\times \widetilde X$. 

Then $X=p_r(\Gamma_j)$ is closed in $\widetilde X$ and so $X=\overline X=\widetilde X$. Hence $X$ is compact. 

> [!proposition]
> Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism, with $X$ complete, then $f(X)$ is closed in $Y$ and is complete.

**_Proof._**
As $Y$ is a variety, $\Gamma_f=\{(x,f(x))\in X\times Y\}\subseteq X\times Y$ closed. 15:29


> [!proposition]
> If $X$ and $Y$ are complete, then $X \times Y$ is complete.

**_Proof._**
Since $X\times Y\times Z\to Y\times Z\to Z$ is closed, we have $(X\times Y)\times Z\to Z$ is closed.

Later, we will show $\mathbb{P}^n$ is complete. By [[MATH/代数几何/Nodes/1.9 Complete Variety#^tbgc8l\|#^tbgc8l]] any projective variety is complete. 

> [!proposition]
> An affine variety $X$ is complete only if $\operatorname{dim} X=0$, i.e., $X$ consists in a single point.

> [!lemma] Nakayama lemma
> Let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module, and let $I\subseteq R$ be an ideal of $R$. If $M=IM$, then there exists $f=1+r$ with $r\in I$ such that $f\cdot M=0$. 

**Remark.** If we write $f=1-i$, then $fm=(1-i)m=0$ and so $m=im$ for any $m$. In wikipedia, this lemma has slogan as $M=IM$ yields there exists $i\in I$ such that $m=im$.
