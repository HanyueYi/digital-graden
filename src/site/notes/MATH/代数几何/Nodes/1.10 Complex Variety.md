? Some Properties
1. Zariski open/closed $\subseteq$ Analytic open/closed

2. If $f:X\to Y$ is a morphism, then $f:X^{\mathrm{an}}\to Y^{\mathrm{an}}$ is a morphism. 
3. locally closed yields induces topology
4. $X^{\mathrm{an}}\times Y^{\mathrm{an}}$ product topology is homeomorphic to $(X\times Y)^{\mathrm{an}}$.
5. $X$ variety yields $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ Hausdorff, because $\Delta_X$ is Zariski closed.

**_Proof._**
For an affine variety $X$ and $U=X\setminus V(I)$, we have $U\supseteq X\setminus V(f)=X_f$. $\overline {(X_f)^{\mathrm{an}}}=X$ means for any $f(x_0)=0$, there exists $z_n\in X_f$ such that $z_n\to z_0$. 



next time: complete iff compact.

补了上节课卡住的：X variety embedding $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $\mathbb{C}^m$ are equivalent. 


> [!proposition]
> Let $X$ be a prevariety over $\mathbb{C}$. Then $X$ is variety iff $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ is Hausdorff.

**_Proof._**
"->" Assume that $X$ is a variety, then $\Delta\subseteq X\times X$ is closed in Zariski topology and $\Delta^{\mathrm{an}}\subseteq(X\times X)^{\mathrm{an}}$ is closed in analytic topology. Note that $(X\times X)^{\mathrm{an}}=X^{\mathrm{an}}\times X^{\mathrm{an}}$, then $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ is Hausdorff. 

"<-" $\Delta\subseteq X\times X$ is a locally closed subvariety. Since affine variety is a variety, then for each affine $X_i$, $\Delta_i\subseteq X_i\times X_i$ is closed. Write $X=\cup_{i=1}^{\ell} X_i$, then $\Delta=\cup_{i=1}^\ell \Delta_i$ where $\Delta_i$ is closed in $X_i\times X_i$. 



> [!theorem]
> Let $X$ be a variety over $\mathbb{C}$. Then $X$ is complete iff $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ is compact. 

**_Proof._**
"<-" Assume that $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ is compact. It suffices to show for any variety $Y$, closed $Z\subseteq X\times Y$ and $p:X\times Y\to Y$, we have $p(Z)$ is closed. 

Claim that $p(Z)^\mathrm{an}$ is closed. It is enough to show for $\{y_n\}\subseteq p(Z)$ and $y_n\to y$ in $Y$, there is $y\in p(Z)$. 
Hence there exist $(x_n,y_n)\in Z$ such that $p(x_n,y_n)=y_n$. Since $X$ is compact, there exists a convergent subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ and we assume that $x_{n_k}\to x$. Hence $(x_{n_k},y_{n_k})\to (x,y)$. Since $Z$ is closed, $(x,y)\in Z$ and so $y\in p(Z)$. Therefore, $p(Z)^{\mathrm{an}}$ is closed. 

Then $p(Z)$ is a constructible set. There exist open $U_i$ and irreducible closed $Y_i$ such that $p(Z)=\cup_{i=1}^\ell (U_i\cap Y_i)$. (这里好像不是因为constructible，但是Delta_i确实可以写成开集交闭集什么的？) Since $\cup_{i=1}^\ell Y_i\supseteq p(Z)=\overline{p(Z)^\mathrm{an}}\supseteq\cup{\overline{U_i\cap Y_i}^\mathrm{an}}=\cup Y_i^\mathrm{an}=\cup Y_i$. Hence $p(Z)=\cup Y_i$ is closed. 

"->" We first prove if $X$ is projective, then $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ is compact. Define 

$$\theta:S=\{(x_0,\cdots,x_n):|x_0|^2+\cdots+|x_n|^2=1\}\to (\mathbb{P}^n)\mathrm{an},(x_0,\cdots,x_n)\mapsto [x_0:\cdots:x_n]$$

then $\theta$ is surjective continuous in analytic topology, Since $S$ is compact, then $\theta(S)$ is compact. 

If $X$ is complete, by Chow's lemma, there exists a projective variety $Y$ such that $Y\stackrel{\pi}{\to}X$ is a birational morphism. Since $Y^\mathrm{an}$ is compact and $\pi$ is a continuous map, $\pi^{\mathrm{an}}(Y^\mathrm{an})=X^\mathrm{an}$ is compact.

- $X,Y$ birational, $U_x\subseteq X$ and$U_y\subseteq Y$ Zariski open such that $U_x\simeq U_y$（15:31 好像是证明
- $X$ variety yields $Y$ complete variety such that $X\subseteq Y$ is an open set

$X$ is a closed analytic variety (locally zeros of analytic functions), by Chow's theorem, $Z$ is a Zariski subset.
