Let $A$ be an algebra over a commutative ring $R$, and let $U$ be an $A$-module. If $R\to R'$ is a homomorphism to another commutative ring $R'$, we form the $R'$-algebra $R'\otimes_R A$, and $R'\otimes_R U$ becomes an $R'\otimes_R A$-module. 
- If $R$ is a subring of $R'$, we say that the module $R'\otimes_R U$ is obtained from $U$ by extending the scalar form $R$ to $R'$. 
	- If an $R'\otimes_R A$-module $V$ has the form $R'\otimes_R U$, we say that $V$ is written in $R$. 
	- When $U$ is free as an $R$-module, we can identify $U$ with $1_{R'}\otimes_R U$, and an $R$-basis of $U$ becomes an $R'$-basis of $R'\otimes_R U$. 
- If $R'=R/I$ with an ideal $I\subseteq R$, applying $R'\otimes _R\cdot$ to an $R$-module $U$ is the same as reducing $U$ module $I$. 
	- If $V$ is an $R'\otimes_R A$-module of the form $R'\otimes_R U$ for some $A$-module $U$, then we say $V$ can be lifted to $U$ and $U$ is a lift of $V$.

> [!proposition]
> Let $F\subseteq E$ be fields where $E$ is algebraic over $F$, and let $A$ be a finite-dimensional $F$-algebra. Let $V$ be a finitely-dimensional $E\otimes_FA$-module. Then there exists a field $K$ with $F\subseteq K\subseteq E$ of finite degree over $F$ so that $V$ is written in $K$. 

**_Proof._**
Let $a^1,\cdots,a^n$ be an $F$-basis of $A$, and let $a^t$ acts $V$ with matrix $(a_{ij}^t)_d$ w.r.t. some $E$-basis $\{v_1,\cdots,v_d\}$ of $V$. Then $K=F[a_{ij}^t:1\leqslant t\leqslant n,1\leqslant i,j\leqslant d]$  and $[K:F]<\infty$. Note that $A$ acts on $V$ by matrices over the field $K$. 

To show $V$ is written in $K$, it suffices to find a $K\otimes_F A$-module $U$ such that $V\simeq E\otimes_K U$. 

Define $U=\sum_{j=1}^d Kv_j=\oplus_{j=1}^d Kv_j\subseteq V$. Since $A$ acts on $V$ by matrices over the field $K$, we know $(1\otimes a^t)(\sum k_jv_j)\in U$ and so $U$ is a $K\otimes _F A$-module. 

Since $\{v_1,\cdots,v_d\}$ is a set of $K$-basis of $U$, $E\otimes_K U$ has $E$-basis $\{1\otimes v_j:1\leqslant j\leqslant d\}$. Define 

$$\psi:E\otimes_K U\to V,e\otimes u\mapsto eu,$$

then $\psi$ is an isomorphism between $E$-vector spaces. Furthermore, notice that 

$$\begin{aligned}
\psi((1 \otimes a^t) \cdot\left(e \otimes_K v_j\right))&=\psi\left(e \otimes_K\left(\left(1 \otimes a^t\right) \cdot v_j\right)\right)=e \cdot\left(\left(1 \otimes a^t\right) \cdot v_j\right)\\&=\left(1 \otimes a^t\right) \cdot\left(e v_j\right)=\left(1 \otimes a^t\right)\psi\left(e \otimes_K v_j\right)\end{aligned}$$

and so $\psi$ is an morphism between $E\otimes_F A$-modules.

> [!definition]
> Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional $F$-algebra where $F$ is a field. A Simple $A$-module $U$ is said to be *absolutely simple* if $E\otimes_F U$ is simple as an $E\otimes _FA$-module for all extension field $E$ of $F$. 


> [!definition]
> We say an extension field $E$ of $F$ is a *splitting field* of $A$ if every simple $E\otimes_F A$-module is absolutely irreducible. 


> [!proposition]
> Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional $F$-algebra over field $F$, and let $U$ be a simple $A$-module. TFAE:
> - $U$ is absolutely irreducible;
> - $\mathrm{End}_A(U)=F$;
> - The matrix algebra summand of $A/J(A)$ corresponding to $U$ has the form $M_n(F)$ where $n=\dim_FU$. 

**_Proof._**
ii)->iii) is trivial.

iii)->i) Note that $A/J(A)\simeq \mathrm{M}_n(F)\oplus\cdots$, and we know $M_n(F)$ is an $A$-module. Since $U$ is simple, $U\simeq F^n$. 


$F\subseteq E$ field extension. 

$E\otimes_F A$ acts $E\otimes _F U\simeq E^n$ and $E\otimes_F A\to M_n(E)\simeq E\otimes_F M_n(F)$. 

$E^n$ is simple as an $M_n(E)$-module. 

$E\otimes _FU$ is simple as an $E\otimes_F A$-module. 

i)->ii) is omitted.

# Group Representations

> [!lemma]
> A morphism $f:(X, \rho) \rightarrow\left(X^{\prime}, \rho^{\prime}\right)$ in $\operatorname{Rep}(G, \mathscr{C})$ is an isomorphism iff the morphism $f: X \rightarrow X^{\prime}$ is an isomorphism in $\mathscr{C}$.

> [!definition]
> Two representations $(X, \rho)$ and $\left(X, \rho^{\prime}\right)$ on the same object $X$ are isomorphic if there exists automorphism $f$ of $X$ such that for all $g \in G, \rho^{\prime}(g)=f \rho(g) f^{-1}$.

**Remark.** We say $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are uniformly conjugate. 

Let $(X,\rho)$ and $(Y,\sigma)$ be $\mathcal C$-representations of $G$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is a category. Then group $\mathrm{Aut}(X)\times \mathrm{Aut}(Y)$ acts on the set $\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal C}(X,Y)$ by $f^{(\alpha,\beta)}=\beta f\alpha^{-1}$. Compose it with diagonal morphism 

$$G\to \mathrm{Aut}(X)\times \mathrm{Aut}(Y),g\mapsto(\rho(g),\sigma(g)).$$

Define an action of $G$ on $\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$, $f^g=\sigma(g)f\rho(g)^{-1}$ for all $g\in G$, and it induces the following commutative diagram.

The automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ can act on the category of representations of $G$ (denoted $\mathscr{C}$-representations, meaning representations on objects of some category $\mathscr{C}$).
2.  **Definition of the Action:**
Given a representation $(X, \rho)$ and an automorphism $a \in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$. The action of $a$ on $(X, \rho)$ results in a **new representation**, denoted ${}^a(X, \rho)$, which is defined by ${}^a\rho(g) = \rho(a^{-1}(g))$.
